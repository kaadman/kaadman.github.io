                "It's really lonely when you started realizing that the all-knowing, omnipotent creature you believed
                since childhood doesn't exist. You rely on him saving you all the hardships and hopeless moments in your
                life. I guess it's just too hard to rely solely on ourselves because we know there's a limitation of
                what we can do. And it gets depressing knowing there's only little you can do when you want so much
                more."
